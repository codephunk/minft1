# MINFT1
###### A minting toolkit for the Chia Blockchain.

## Setup Instructions

### Place the directory `minft1/` in the `chia/wallet/` directory
### Install additional dependencies 
```
pip install git+https://github.com/nftstorage/python-client.git
pip install gino
```

### You will need a PostgreSQL databse
You can run this [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) db locally.

### Set ENV variable so that marmot_db_api.py can connect to the database

```
self.mode = os.getenv("MODE")
self.host = os.getenv("DB_HOST")
self.port = int(os.getenv("DB_PORT"))
self.user = os.getenv("DB_USER")
self.password = os.getenv("DB_PASS")
self.database = os.getenv("DB_NAME")
```

### Customize collection info
You will have to create an [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/) account and get an api key.

Edit this section in the `marmot_server.py` file:

```
RECEIVE_ADDRESS = "xch..."
ROYALTY_ADDRESS = "xch..."

XCH_PRICE = 500000000000
NFT_STORAGE_API_KEY = "NFT_STORAGE_API_KEY"
DID_ID = ""
NFT_WALLET_ID = 5
WEBSITE = "https://"
BANNER_URL = "https://"
ICON_URL = "https://"
TWITTER = "@..."
COLLECTION_DESCRIPTION = "Mrmrmrm"
COLLECTION_NAME = "Marmot World Order"
ROYALTY_PERCENTAGE = 3000
```

You will have to create an Open AI account, get access to DALL-E, and get authorization token. Put this token in marmot_get.py
```
  bearer = "Bearer sess-xxxx"
 ```

### Make sure you have local wallet running and that it is synced

### Run the minter
```python
python chia/wallet/minft1/server.py
```
